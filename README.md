# Web Application Security Scanner

A web application security scanner to detect vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. This tool is designed to help security professionals and developers quickly test web applications for common vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **SQL Injection (SQLi) Detection**: Identifies SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection**: Detects potential XSS vulnerabilities in web forms and input fields.
- **Customizable**: Easily add more vulnerability checks as per your requirements.
- **Simple to Use**: Run the scanner on any target URL to test for common vulnerabilities.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine using git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-application-security-scanner.git
   cd web-application-security-scanner
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for your project:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).

## Usage

To run the scanner, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python scanner.py
```

You will need to modify the `scanner.py` file to point to the target URL you want to test. For example, you can call the functions for SQL Injection or XSS detection directly on specific URLs.

### Example:

```python
# Example usage to test for SQL Injection
test_sql_injection("http://example.com/product?id=1")

# Example usage to test for XSS
test_xss("http://example.com/search?query=sample")
```

## Additional Features

- **Add More Vulnerability Checks**: Easily extend the tool by adding more vulnerability checks. Just add new functions to `scanner.py` for detecting other common vulnerabilities.
  
- **Generate Reports**: Consider adding support to generate reports in various formats (e.g., PDF or HTML) for easier sharing and documentation of test results.
